Hi there!ðŸ˜„

I'm Debbie.
I have a keen interest in cybersecurity and AI, having delved into these domains through various projects and completing courses through TryHackMe and local hackathons. 
While my hands-on project experience is still growing, my dedication to mastering these disciplines remains steadfast!
